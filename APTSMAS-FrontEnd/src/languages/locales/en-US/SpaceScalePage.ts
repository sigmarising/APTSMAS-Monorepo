    "Space Scale Time Variant page is designed to dynamically change with the time of year, and to visualize the results of migration trajectories of different poets. \nThe map module will show the migration changes of many different poets in the form of dots and lines. The thicker the line, the more people use this trajectory pattern, and the thicker the dot, the more visited the place. The map module supports zoom and drag operations. \nTime dynamics will allow the year to stop when it reaches the maximum value, and the time reset button can reset the changing time to the minimum value at any time.",
